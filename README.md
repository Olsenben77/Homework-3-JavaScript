# Homework-3-JavaScript

This third homework assignment and Github repository features a randomly generated Javascript Password Generator. The purpose of the functional site is to take in user input according to a variety of selectors, and output a "personalized" password adhering to the set criteria. This application features HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and the newly learned JavaScript to run the program effectively. JavaScript is used to run various confirms, prompts, and alerts needed to run the user through the selection process.

## Motivation
I created this Password Generator to practice and increase my abilities in JavaScript coding. This was a challenging exercise in combining several weeks of learned information into a functional application.

## Features
Homework 3 features beginner-level HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, but focuses more handedly on JavaScript and its role in making a user-responsive experience. The application contains multiple prompts and confirms, asking the user to specify password-length, character/number type, and symbol inclusion. The displayed buttons work to generate the JavaScript and the given textbox displays user results. As a whole, this program runs the user through a set-list of questions, to help generate a completely random and secure password that they could not obtain on their own.
